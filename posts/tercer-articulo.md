In many modern interfaces, modals are essential for displaying information without redirecting users to a different page. In this article, I’ll walk you through how I developed a fully reusable modal using React and TailwindCSS.

## Why Use a Reusable Modal?

Modals are components that appear on top of the main content to show alerts, forms, confirmations, or details. If not properly managed, they can lead to code duplication or accessibility issues.

That’s why I created a modal component that can be easily reused throughout the project—simply by calling it with props.

## Components Used

- `Modal.tsx`: The base component
- `useState`: To control visibility
- `React Portal` (optional): To mount the modal outside the normal DOM flow

This reusable modal component was born out of a need to create cleaner and more consistent interfaces, and it became a clear example of how React and TailwindCSS can boost front-end development efficiency. Have you built something similar or are thinking about integrating a custom modal in your project? I’d love to hear your take on it!
