One of the key components in any modern web application is authentication. In this article, I explain how I implemented a robust authentication system using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) in a Node.js and Express project.

## The Underlying Issue

When working with full-stack applications, securing protected routes and ensuring that only authorized users can access specific functionalities is a top priority. To achieve this, an efficient and secure authentication and authorization strategy is essential.

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js + Express:** Backend with RESTful endpoints
- **MongoDB + Mongoose:** Database and user schema
- **bcrypt:** Password encryption
- **jsonwebtoken (JWT):** Token generation and verification
- **Postman:** Route testing for protected endpoints

## Authentication Flow

1. The user registers with their data and password.
2. The password is encrypted using bcrypt before being stored.
3. When logging in, the password is validated and a JWT containing essential user information is generated.
4. The token is sent back to the client and used in every request to protected routes via the Authorization header.
5. The backend validates the token on each protected route before responding.

## Protection Middleware

I developed middleware in Express that intercepts requests to protected routes and validates the JWT before granting access. This keeps the code modular and highly reusable.

This JWT-based authentication system addressed the urgent need to secure routes and sensitive data in a Node.js application, and ended up being a clear example of applying backend security best practices. Are you exploring similar solutions or have your own approach to authentication? I'd love to hear about it!
